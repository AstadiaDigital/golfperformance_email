    <h4>The Go To Shot</h4>
    <p>Most of us have heard PGA/LPGA Tour players talk about their "go to shots".</p>
    <p>Go to shots are your safest bets. They play to your strengths, working around your limitations in favor of shots with higher probabilities of getting in play.</p>

    <h6>The fade shot</h6>
    <p>Over 95% of all golfers hit a "fade" or "cut" shot to make up for limitations like low rotation or an early extension with the hips, for example. In a fade, the angle the club makes in moving back to the ball (out to in) makes it easier to hit.</p>

    <h6>Learn your limitations</h6>
    <p>The fade shot is just one example of a go to shot. I’ve found success helping players find a shot that fits their limitations. If you already know your physical limitations, use them to develop the right go to shot for you. If you don’t, work with a coach to discover them and then identify the right shot.</p>

    <h6>When to use a go to shot</h6>
    <p>Use your go to shot based on the situation. Let’s say you’re in a club championship hunt and need to get the ball in play, but your nerves are firing. This might be the time to rely on your go to shot.</p>

    <p>Times when you’re struggling to get the ball in play are also perfect for this reliable tactic.</p>

    <h6>Developing your go to shot:</h6>
    <p>Play to your normal tendency:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If your tendency is toward a fade line up on the right side of tee box, aim down the left hand side of fairway and let it go.</li>
      <li>If it’s a "draw" or "hook," line up on the left side of [the] tee box and aim down the right side of the fairway.</li>
      <li>Use a shorter club if that makes you feel more comfortable, or your favorite club!</li>
      <li>Ball position should stay center or slightly forward of center. If this is uncomfortable, play normal ball position.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Finish balanced and your chances of getting the ball in play will increase 100%.</p>

    <h4>An easy way to stay in shape over vacation</h4>
    <p>An easy way to stay in shape over vacation

    <p>Taking planned time off is crucial for performance gains. This this doesn't mean being a couch potato who only gets up to go grab more chips and salsa. We’ve identified special workouts to help balance rest time with staying in shape.</p>

    <p>It's a simple equation; the longer you go without maintaining a regular schedule, the faster your performance will decrease. After two weeks of inactivity, the strength and endurance you’ve built up start to decline.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, once this starts to happen, it will take close to six weeks to get it back. But don’t worry, we have a solution!</p>

    <p>Here are three vacation workouts to complete every other day. All you need is your body weight and an FMT band. Come see us if you need guidance on getting started.</p>

    <p>See you in the Zone!</p>

    <h4>Tee Shot First</h4>

    <p>Every hole is asking to be played a certain way. Statistically, taking a unique approach to each hole leads to the lowest scoring average, but this approach is often overlooked.</p>

    <h6>Play it safe, play it smart, or both?</h6>
    Recently, standing on the first tee of a tournament and feeling the inevitable nerves, I was faced with a decision:</p>

    <h6>Hit [a] driver</h6>
    <p>Should I hit [a] driver on a fairly short par 4, take on the narrow part of the fairway, and leave myself a wedge in? </p>

    <h6>Hit a hybrid</h6>
    <p>Or, should I hit a hybrid, laying back to the wider part of the fairway to earn a mid-iron approach?  </p>

    <p>The confident part of me said to lay back, knowing I’m capable of hitting a quality mid- iron shot into the green. Another part of me felt I had to hit [a] driver. This would leave me with a wedge, and a better chance at making birdie. Fortunately, I chose the hybrid, and left myself an 8-iron approach into the green. Not only did this lead to a green in regulation, but also set the tone for the day.</p>

    <h6>Take it as it comes</h6>
    <p>After that I played each hole as it was asked to be played. This took pressure off the tee shot, making it just a way to set up opportunities to make birdie. This was the confident approach, not hitting [a] driver into a narrow part of the fairway.</p>

    <p>Keeping stats from each round and identifying your strengths will help you come up with game plans for each hole. This gives you the best opportunity to make birdie or par.</p>

    <p>Practice Smart!</p>

    <h4>Choose BPA-free containers</h4>

    <p>It’s crucial to stay hydrated during the course of a round or in a workout. The container you use is equally important. Where you can, choose BPA-free containers.</p>

    <h6>What is BPA?</h6>
    <p>BPA (bisphenol A) is an industrial chemical used in certain polycarbonate plastics and resins since the 1960's. You’ll find BPA in food and beverage containers, including water bottles. The FDA says BPA, which can seep into food or drinks, is safe at very low levels. However, some research suggests it can lead to health concerns.</p>

    <h6>How to avoid BPA</h6>
    <p>While the evidence isn’t conclusive yet, it’s best to be safe. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the label to see if containers are BPA-free (like your new Amino Vital water bottle)</li>
      <li>Cut back on cans</li>
      <li>Avoid exposing containers to heat </li>
      <li>Use glass or stainless steel containers </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Be Well.</p>

    <h4>The right tools for the job</h4>

    <p>The right equipment plays to all of the strengths you’ve developed through workouts, practice and play. Here is the process we follow at the Golf Performance Center SWAG Shop to get an ideal fit for every player:</p>

    <h6>Step 1: EVALUATION</h6>
    <p>Evaluate your current set to create a baseline for your fitting. Measure the loft, lie, length, grip size, swing weight and frequency of each club.</p>

    <h6>Step 2: FITTING</h6>
    <p>Use state-of-the-art launch monitor technologies, paired with golf clubs and shafts to find the best combination.</p>

    <h6>Step 3: RECOMMENDATIONS</h6>
    <p>Recommend specifications of the best clubs suited for the golfer and his or her game.</p>

    <h6>Step 4: BETTER GOLF</h6>
    <p>Build new clubs to the exact, recommended specifications.</p>

    <h4>Face the angle or club path?</h4>

    <p>What has a greater impact on the launch direction of the golf ball, face angle or club path? Let’s start with a definition.</p>

    <h6>Face angle</h6>
    <p>This is the direction/angle relative to the indented target line at impact. This can be open (right), closed (left), or square (zero) to the target line for a right-handed golfer. The face angle has great influence on launch direction.</p>

    <h6>Club path </h6>
    <p>Club path is the direction the club is headed relative to the indented target at impact. This can be in-to-out (right), out-to-in (left) or square (zero) to the target line for a right-handed golfer. </p>

    <h6>Both are important</h6>
    <p>I’ve found that most golfers emphasize club path and forget about the importance of face angle. The next time you’re hitting balls, check the numbers for both your club path and face angle. This could have a dramatic effect on your practice session. </p>

    <h4>Preparing for your practice round</h4>

    <p>We’ve discussed this before, but tournament season is the right time to touch on it again: Practice rounds are the most important way to familiarize yourself with the course. Yardages in particular are something to pay attention to.</p>

    <h6>Don’t rely on a rangefinder alone</h6>
    <p>There is a lot more that goes into a shot then just the exact yardage from a rangefinder. Players should always identify the best spot on the ball to hit in order to make the putt. Also consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change of elevation</li>
      <li>Wind</li>
      <li>Distance to carry bunkers and hazards</li>
      <li>Where to leave it on the green based on slopes and undulation</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Take good notes</h6>
    <p>Make notes about these factors prior to playing a competitive round. This is why we give you the chance to play practice rounds. Good notes provide you with a less stressful round.</p>

    <p>Play Well.</p>
